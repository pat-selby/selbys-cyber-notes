# What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Multi-Factor Authentication (or MFA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts.

Besides your password, it asks for something else â€” like a code sent to your phone â€” to make sure itâ€™s really you logging in.

## Why Use MFA?
- It stops hackers even if they steal your password.
- Itâ€™s quick and easy to set up on most apps and websites.

## How to Turn It On:
Go to your accountâ€™s security settings and look for "Two-Step Verification" or "Multi-Factor Authentication."

ðŸ“± Adding MFA is like having a second lock on your door â€” donâ€™t skip it!
