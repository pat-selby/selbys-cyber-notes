# Spot the Red Flags: Recognize Suspicious Online Activity

Hackers love to sneak in through tricks and fake messages.

Here’s what to watch for:

- Unexpected password reset emails you didn’t ask for.
- Strange login alerts from places you haven’t been.
- Messages asking for personal info or money.
- Friends or contacts sending unusual links or requests.

## What To Do If You Notice Something:
- Change your passwords immediately.
- Enable MFA on your accounts.
- Report suspicious emails or messages to your service provider.
- Tell friends or family if their account seems hacked.
