# Phishing Scams: Don’t Take the Bait!

Phishing is when scammers try to trick you into giving them your personal info, like passwords or credit card numbers.

They might send fake emails or messages that look real, asking you to click links or download files.

## How to Stay Safe from Phishing:
- Don’t click on links or download attachments from unknown senders.
- Check the sender’s email address carefully — does it look suspicious?
- Look for spelling mistakes or urgent messages trying to scare you.
- When in doubt, go directly to the website instead of clicking a link.

🛡️ Remember: Real companies won’t ask for your password or personal info by email!
